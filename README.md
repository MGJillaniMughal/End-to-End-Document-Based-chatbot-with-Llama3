# Document-Based Chatbot with Llama3

## Introduction
Welcome to the Document-Based Chatbot with Llama3, an innovative tool designed to facilitate the exploration and querying of PDF documents using advanced natural language models. This project utilizes the capabilities of Llama3, provided through the LangChain and Groq, to answer questions directly based on the content found within a specified corpus of documents.

## Features
- **Document Interaction**: Users can ask questions and receive answers that are contextually relevant to the contents of the loaded PDF documents.
- **Contextual Awareness**: The chatbot maintains session states to handle queries more intelligently, providing responses based on a broader understanding of the document corpus.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Users can provide immediate feedback on the chatbot's responses, enhancing learning and adaptation.
